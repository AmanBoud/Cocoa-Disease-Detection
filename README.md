# Cocoa-Disease-Detection
Cocoa Disease Detection is a machine learning project that identifies diseases in cocoa plant leaves using image classification. It uses a CNN model trained on leaf images to classify them as healthy or diseased. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, it helps in early detection for better crop management.
