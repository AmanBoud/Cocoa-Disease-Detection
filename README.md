# Cocoa-Disease-Detection
Cocoa Disease Detection is a machine learning project that identifies diseases in cocoa plant leaves using image classification. It uses a CNN model trained on leaf images to classify them as healthy or diseased. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, it helps in early detection for better crop management.

# 🍫 Cocoa Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to identify diseases in cocoa plants using image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural experts in detecting cocoa diseases early, ensuring better yield and crop health.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cocoa is a vital crop for many tropical countries. Diseases affecting cocoa plants can severely impact production. This system uses trained machine learning models to classify plant leaf images into healthy or disease-affected categories.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Model Type**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Dataset**: Custom image dataset of healthy and diseased cocoa leaves

## 🚀 Features

- Image classification for healthy vs. diseased leaves
- Real-time prediction using webcam or uploaded image
- Simple and intuitive user interface (if applicable)
- Trained model with high accuracy on test data
